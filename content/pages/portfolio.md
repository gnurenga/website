## About Me

I am a Senior Software Engineer with 15+ years of experience building production-grade systems.

My career began in embedded firmware and Linux platform engineering, and over the last several years I have focused primarily on Python-based backend systems, automation platforms, and large-scale system integrations.

I specialize in building reliable, observable, and maintainable systems that operate in real-world production environments.

---

## What I Focus On

- Designing backend tools and services in Python
- Building internal platforms that reduce operational overhead
- Automating complex workflows
- Developing integration and validation systems
- Improving observability and debugging capabilities
- Solving networking and performance-related issues

---

## Engineering Strengths

### Product Mindset

- Design for reliability and long-term maintainability
- Focus on operational simplicity
- Build systems that are easy to debug and extend
- Reduce manual processes through automation
- Take ownership from design to production support

### Systems Thinking

My embedded and Linux background enables me to:

- Debug across layers (network → OS → application)
- Understand performance bottlenecks
- Analyze real-world traffic behavior
- Design robust integration systems

---

## Selected Work

### Production Deployment Automation Platform

Designed and implemented a Python-based deployment system that:

- Pulled controlled updates from version control
- Integrated with production REST APIs
- Enabled safe and repeatable releases

**Impact:**
- Reduced manual release steps
- Improved deployment reliability
- Lowered production risk

---

### OTA Configuration Management System

Built a Flask-based backend service to manage dynamic URL configuration updates in production environments.

System responsibilities:

- Receive HTTP-based update triggers
- Fetch configuration bundles
- Validate and process data
- Deploy safely to live servers

**Impact:**
- Automated recurring operational tasks
- Reduced human error
- Improved turnaround time for updates

---

### Internet Traffic Analytics & Reporting Platform

Developed a Python/Flask analytics platform that:

- Processes large traffic datasets
- Generates structured CSV reports
- Produces visual summaries for analysis
- Supports airline-level and user-level insights

**Impact:**
- Enabled data-driven decision making
- Improved visibility into traffic behavior
- Reduced manual reporting effort

---

### Automation & Validation Framework (Robot Framework)

Built reusable Python test libraries to validate:

- DHCP relay behavior
- User subscription mapping
- Traffic routing correctness
- RADIUS-based simulations

**Impact:**
- Increased test coverage
- Reduced regression issues
- Improved release confidence

---

### Observability & Logging Improvements

Integrated centralized logging mechanisms into Linux-based systems:

- Routed application and system logs
- Enabled structured debugging workflows
- Improved production issue resolution time
