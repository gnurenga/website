== Overview

Testing is a part of product life cycle. I wonder is there any tool or
programing language which will be fun to work with except
python. Since python is grown in such a way that even a non programmer
become a programmer. In case of testing team, traditionaly there is a
image that they won't code. But python fills the gap between coding
and testing.


Still many people doesn't know the power of Python and Robotframe work
in testing field.

The main objective of this article is to give an Example of an
Embedded system and how that can be tested using python and robotframe
work.

Actually I am rewriting this article which I posted in stack overflow
documentation (How robot framework is used in Automation testing in
Embedded Systems?). Since documentation beta is closed by Stack
Overflow.

I am writing this article because I like to make testing team to have
a taste of coding.

== Requirements to build the RPS

Requirements for building a remote power supply are

    Remote power supply should be able to turn ON/OFF remotely
    Remote power supply status can be accessed remotely.



== Remote Power supply simulation

Since we don't have a real remote power supply hardware, we are going
to simulate it using python program.

=== Basic idea about RPS

* Actually remote power supply has a http server.
* User can send commands to turn ON/OFF power supply using http request.

We are going to simulate remote power supply using following program
rps-server.py.

[source, python]
----
include::src/rps-server.py[]
----

=== How to run rps server ?

----
$ export FLASK_APP=rps-server.py
$ flask run
----

=== How to send commands to rps server ?


Following are the two commands used to control the RPS

----
    1. SetPower
    2. GetPower
----

By default the server will be listening at the port 5000.

The power supply ports are,

----
    P60
    P61
    P62
    P64
----

The states of the ports are,

----
    ON - 1
    OFF - 0
----

== Deriving test cases

Now the RPS server is ready for simulation.
We need to write test case to test RPS system.

=== Test cases derived from requirement

    Turn on Power supply 2 remotely.
    Verify power supply 2 is on.
    Turn off Power supply 2 remotely.
    Verify power supply 2 is off.

=== Manual Testing

    * Run the rps server.
    * To turn on Port 3, open a browser and give following URI

----
http://admin:12345678@localhost:5000/SetCmd?CMD=SetPower&P62=1
----
    * To get the status of all the ports

----
http://admin:12345678@localhost:5000/SetCmd?CMD=GetPower
----

== Writing test library

We need to write a test library in python for sending http commands
using http request. Later we will be using this library as keywords in
robot frame work.


We are going to use library from commands.py to send SetPower and GetPower.

Source code commands.py
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

[source, python]
----
include::src/commands.py[]
----

<1> The scope of the variable will available through all test case
<2> Send Cmds is the key word we are going to use.

=== Python Keyword documentation for send_cmds

* `send_cmds(cmd, port=None, state=None)` is the function we are going to use.
* While using this function in Robot key word, no need to bother about `_`, or `Lowercaser` or `Uppercase` in function name.

Robot keyword derived from python function

----
Send Cmds       cmd   port  state
----

== Writing Robot keyword using Python Library

We are going to use `Send Cmds` as python keyword in test suite.

* RPS send commands uses following three arguments to set power
** command = SetPower
** port = 2
** state = 1 for ON / 0 for off When we call that command it will turn ON/OFF the power supply

----
*** Keywords ***
RPS send commands
    [Arguments]    ${command}    ${port}    ${state}
    ${output}=    Send cmds    ${command}  ${port}  ${state}
    [return]    ${output}

RPS get Power
    [Arguments]    ${command}
    ${output}=    Send cmds    ${command}
    [return]    ${output}}
----

=== Algorithm to test power supply

* Set power to a port
* Check the status of cmd
* Get the status of the port and check whether it is ON/OFF


== Writing Test Suite using test case we derived

Now we are ready to write test suite using following two keywords

* RPS send commands - To set and unset a power of port
* RPS get power - To get the status of all the port

----
*** Settings ***
Library      ../library/commands.py  # Import the library

*** Test Cases ***
Turn on Power supply 2 remotely
     ${out}=    RPS send commands     SetPower  2  1
     Should be equal    ${out}  ${True}

Verify power supply 2 is on
    ${out}=     RPS get power    GetPower
    should contain    ${out}  P62=1

Turn off Power supply 2 remotely
     ${out}=    RPS send commands     SetPower  2  0
     Should be equal    ${out}  ${True}

Verify power supply 2 is off
    ${out}=     RPS get power    GetPower
    should contain    ${out}  P62=0

*** Keywords ***
RPS send commands
    [Arguments]    ${command}    ${port}    ${state}
    ${output}=    Send cmds    ${command}  ${port}  ${state}
    [return]    ${output}

RPS get Power
    [Arguments]    ${command}
    ${output}=    Send cmds    ${command}
    [return]    ${output}}
----

Note: A keywords can be put as seprate a file and import in test suite
